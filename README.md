This is the repository we are going to use to convert mr Mitchell's BASIC programs to programs that will run on a modern 
computer. As such any language is acceptable as long as it will run on a windows install above XP. Just make sure to 
edit the makefile with the appropriate commands to compile your program to a exe [For now this does not apply to interpreted
languages such as python, php, ruby, etc}
